## Basics

The primary data structure in nifty is the `struct`.

![struct](/images/struct.svg)

## Default Values

![struct_defaults](/images/struct_defaults.svg)

## Pointer Ownership

Adding @ to the end of a pointer type type indicates that the object pointed to is owned by the struct and should be deleted when the struct is deleted.

## Attributes

Structs can also have attributes.
